###   DEAZONE ROADMAP FOR THE PACKAGE "deadzone.graphics"   ###
###############################################################


- Debug ortho projection: The matrix is applied, but the projection still does not work -> check createOrthoProjectionMatrix()

- Implement textures/UV coordinates to the fragment shader

- Read what function you have to execute in OpenGL for onResize to recalculate the window size
  and introduce a corresponding logic for this

- Stack memory deallocation through Garbage Collector doesn't seem to work as excepted.
  After ~340 Frames, we run out of stack space.
  => Do the de-allocation manually OR do the allocation optimization now
     (probably the strong references which are recreated again in each loop prevents them from getting garbage collected)
