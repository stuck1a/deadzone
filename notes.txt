###   DEAZONE ROADMAP FOR THE PACKAGE "deadzone.graphics"   ###
###############################################################


- ortho projection: Camera view is not yet 45Â° diagonal - fix as soon as textures/fonts are implemented, so that its easier to fix

- Implement logic for proper UV mapping of geometric objects
  => How to handle UV's?
      => Possibility 1: Make them fix for each geometric mesh
                        Maybe with several predefined setups like "Stretch", "Keep ratio" and so on.
                        At least for things like Tiles this would absolutely make sense. But everything else would become pretty limited by doing so
                        BUT are there even such general use cases where that would matter? Do i really need a lot of different texture forms for UI Elements and such?
      => Possibility 2: Specify them manually on each object creation as arguments
      => Possibility 3: Create predefined mappings for each texture (or texture type?) on each geometric mesh -> AssetManager?

- Read what function you have to execute in OpenGL for onResize to recalculate the window size
  and introduce a corresponding logic for this

- Stack memory deloc through Garbage Collector doesn't seem to work as excepted.
  After ~340 Frames, app runs out of stack space.
  => Do the de-allocation manually OR do the allocation optimization now
     (probably the strong references which are recreated again in each loop prevents them from being garbage collected)
