 * This class represents a vertex buffer object and transforms java-sided objects into OpenGL-sided objects.
 * It also moves these objects to the GPU memory and stores the handles to access them.
 *
 * While the VBOs represents a single attribute list (like position attribute, color attribute, ...).
 * All VBOs which in total describe a single renderable object will be grouped together in a VAO.
